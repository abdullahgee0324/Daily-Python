🚀 Day 6 – Mastering Conditions & Loops
"Day 6 of my Python journey 🐍"

Today was all about giving Python its “decision-making power” and its ability to repeat tasks intelligently with conditions and loops.

🔑 What I practiced:

if / elif / else → teaching Python how to choose paths.
Nested conditions → decisions inside decisions.
Logical operators (and, or, not) → combining checks.
Ternary operator (compact one-liner decisions).
For loops → repeating through lists, strings, or ranges.
Break & Continue → controlling the flow of a loop.
Nested loops → pairing adjectives with fruits (fun example!).
Using pass → placeholders for logic I’ll add later.
✨ Reflections:

Writing conditions felt like giving Python a little logic engine—it starts to “decide” rather than just follow one straight line.
Loops showed me how powerful it is to automate repetition—it’s like the difference between copy-pasting and letting Python do the heavy lifting.
Combining them together (loops + conditions) feels like unlocking a new superpower.
👉 My question to the community:
When you were just starting, what exercises or mini-projects helped you feel confident with conditions and loops? I want to sharpen this skill before I dive into building bigger projects tomorrow.

I’ve uploaded today’s full code + notes to my GitHub repo:

Every step forward makes me realize: Python isn’t just about syntax, it’s about learning how to think like a programmer. 🚀
