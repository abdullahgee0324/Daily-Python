This is what i learned today i know its a small thing but on journey to become a successful python developer
# Numbers
age = 25                # Integer
height = 5.9            # Float
complex_number = 3 + 2j # Complex

# Text
name = "Alice"          # String

# Boolean
is_student = True       # Boolean (True/False)

# None
nothing_here = None     # None means "nothing"

# List (a sequence of items, can change later)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Tuple (like a list, but cannot be changed)
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Set (collection of unique items, no duplicates)
colors = {"red", "green", "blue", "red"}

# Dictionary (key-value pairs)
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "is_student": True
}

print("Integer:", age)
print("Float:", height)
print("Complex number:", complex_number)

print("String:", name)

print("Boolean:", is_student)

print("None type:", nothing_here)

print("List:", fruits)
print("Tuple:", coordinates)
print("Set:", colors)
