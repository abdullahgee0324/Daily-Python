# 🐍 Daily Python  

Welcome to my Daily Python learning repo!  
This is where I document my journey of learning Python one step at a time.  

📌 Contents include:  
- Notes on each topic (variables, data types, loops, functions, etc.)  
- Example scripts and practice exercises  
- Small beginner projects and experiments  

I’m sharing this publicly for accountability, consistency, and to connect with others who love Python. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 🚀
