# 🎓 Student Grade Tracker - Using strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries

# Dictionary to store students and their grades (list of tuples: (subject, grade))
gradebook = {
    "Alice": [("Math", 88), ("English", 92), ("History", 79)],
    "Bob":   [("Math", 75), ("English", 85), ("Science", 90)],
    "Carol": [("Math", 92), ("English", 81), ("History", 87), ("Science", 95)]
}

# 1. Use a set to list all unique subjects across students
subjects = set()
for grades in gradebook.values():
    for subject, _ in grades:
        subjects.add(subject)

print("📘 Subjects in this semester:", subjects)

# 2. Loop through each student and calculate average score
for student, grades in gradebook.items():
    total = 0
    for subject, score in grades:
        total += score
    avg = total / len(grades)
    print(f"{student} has an average score of {avg:.2f}")

# 3. Store honor roll students (average >= 90) in a list
honor_roll = []
for student, grades in gradebook.items():
    avg = sum(score for _, score in grades) / len(grades)
    if avg >= 90:
        honor_roll.append(student)

print("🏅 Honor Roll:", honor_roll)
